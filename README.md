How to learn C++ economically.

The 1st project is about pointers.
It consists of 5 sub-projects :  
   1. Basic Intro to Pointers
   2. Another Basic Intro to Pointers
   3. Pointers to simple variables: how to declare and use such pointers
   4. Pointers to arrays of variables: how to declare and use such pointers
   5. Pointers to arrays of objects: how to declare and use such pointers
   
   
   
   More to come as we dig further into C++...
   Thanks for reading my code; have fun with C++
